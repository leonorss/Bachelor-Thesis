Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 123 of /Users/leonorschubert/Desktop/Aramis/ETH/Bachelor Thesis/Code/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/SingleCellReadSimulator3.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
